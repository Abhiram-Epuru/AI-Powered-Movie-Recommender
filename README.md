# AI-Powered-Movie-Recommender
A Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset, leveraging collaborative filtering techniques such as KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The project demonstrates a personalized recommendation model capable of suggesting movies based on user preferences and interaction data.


## Overview
This project is a **Movie Recommendation System** built using the MovieLens dataset. It employs **collaborative filtering** techniques such as **KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)** and **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** to recommend movies based on user preferences and interactions. The system is designed to provide personalized suggestions to users, demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning in recommendation engines.

## Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses user-item similarity for recommendations.
- **KNN-based Recommendations**: Identifies similar users/movies for predictions.
- **SVD Implementation**: Reduces dimensionality for improved accuracy.
- **Scalable Design**: Can handle large datasets with appropriate optimizations.
- **Project Report**: Includes insights into the methodology and results.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **MovieLens**. You can access it from [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhiram Epuru/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
## Future Enhancements
Incorporate content-based filtering for hybrid recommendations.
Add deep learning methods for better accuracy.
Enhance scalability for larger datasets.
